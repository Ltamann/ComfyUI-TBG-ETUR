TBG Enhanced Tiled Upscaler and Refiner Pro – Custom License

Welcome to TBG Enhanced Tiled Upscaler and Refiner Pro!
We at TBG Thinking Building Generating AI Enhancement ("TBG," "we," or "our") are
excited to make our TBG Enhanced Tiled Upscaler and Refiner Pro available to you
for free non-commercial use. We believe in empowering creators and innovators,
which is why anything you create or generate using our software is completely
yours to use however you wish—including for commercial purposes!

What This Means for You:
Your creations are truly yours: Any images, outputs, or content you generate with
our software can be used freely for personal projects, commercial ventures,
selling, publishing, or any other purpose you have in mind.
Free to use for personal and non-commercial purposes: You can use our Community
Edition without any cost for personal projects, research, education, or hobby use.

Important Limitations to Remember:
While we want you to have maximum freedom with your creations, there are some
important boundaries:
- The software itself (not your outputs) is for non-commercial use only
- You cannot modify, sell, or redistribute the software without our permission
- The Pro Version requires API access authorization
- This is alpha software, so use it at your own risk

This license agreement (the "License") governs how you can use the TBG Enhanced
Tiled Upscaler and Refiner Pro software and all its associated components
(collectively, the "Program"). By downloading, installing, or using our software,
you agree to these terms.

If you're looking for commercial use of the software itself, custom licensing
arrangements, or have questions about any of these terms, we're happy to discuss
options that work for everyone. Just contact us!

The "TBG Enhanced Tiled Upscaler and Refiner Pro" or "Program" means the TBG
Enhanced Tiled Upscaler and Refiner Pro AI software and all associated, parameters,
algorithms, software, checkpoints, source code, documentation, manuals,
instructions, and any other materials associated with the TBG Enhanced Tiled
Upscaler and Refiner Pro made available by TBG under this License (collectively,
"Program").

By downloading, accessing, using, Distributing (as defined below), or creating a
Derivative (as defined below) of the Program, you agree to the terms of this
License. If you do not agree to this License, then you do not have any rights to
access, use, Distribute or create a Derivative of the Program and you must
immediately cease using the Program.

1. License Grant
a. Community Edition License. Subject to your compliance with this License, TBG
grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, non-transferable, non-sublicensable,
revocable, royalty free and limited license to access, use, and Distribute the
Community Edition without limitation within the parameters of this License solely
for your Non-Commercial Purposes. The Community Edition may be used without API
access requirements.

b. Pro Version License. The Pro Version requires valid API access credentials
provided by TBG. Use of the Pro Version is only permitted with proper API access
authorization and is subject to additional terms and conditions that may be
specified in the API access agreement. Unauthorized use of the Pro Version without
valid API access is strictly prohibited.

c. Non-Commercial Use Only. You may only access, use, or Distribute the Program for
Non-Commercial Purposes. If you want to use the Program for any purpose that is not
expressly authorized under this License, such as for a commercial activity, you
must request a custom license from TBG, which may be granted in sole discretion and
which additional use may be subject to a fee, royalty or other consideration.
Feel free to create, publish, and sell any content you generate with the Program—
your creations are yours to use commercially—but you may not sell the Program
itself or offer it as an online service for commercial use without explicit written
permission from the author.

d. Prohibited Modifications. You may not modify, adapt, translate, retrain, reverse
engineer, or create Derivatives of the Program without the express written
permission of TBG.

e. Reserved Rights. The grant of rights expressly set forth in this License are the
complete grant of rights to you in the Program, and no other licenses are granted,
whether by waiver, estoppel, implication, equity or otherwise. TBG reserves all
rights not expressly granted by this License.

f. Outputs. TBG claims no ownership rights in and to the Outputs. You are solely
responsible for the Outputs you generate and their subsequent uses in accordance
with this License. You may use Outputs for any purpose (including for commercial
purposes), except as expressly prohibited herein.

g. Right to Modify, Suspend, and Relicense the Program. TBG may, at its sole
discretion and at any time, modify, update, or otherwise change the Program or its
API—without prior notice or liability. This includes the authority to disable the
system entirely or deactivate any Pro features. The API and Pro version are funded
by donations from users; if contributions become insufficient to cover operating
costs, TBG reserves the right to suspend service without further notice.
Additionally, TBG may elect to relicense the entire Program under the GNU General
Public License, thereby providing free access to all functionality and source code.

2. Definitions
a. "Community Edition" means the version of the Program made available for general
use without API access requirements, subject to the limitations and conditions set
forth in this License.

b. "Pro Version" means the enhanced version of the Program that requires API access
authorization and is subject to additional usage restrictions as defined herein.

c. "API Access" means the authorized access credentials, keys, or authentication
mechanisms required to use the Pro Version of the Program, as provided by TBG.

d. "Derivative" means any modified version of the Program (including but not
limited to any customized version thereof), work based on the Program, or any other
derivative work thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, Outputs are not considered
Derivatives under this License.

e. "Distribution" or "Distribute" or "Distributing" means providing or making
available, by any means, a copy of the Program and/or the Derivatives as the case
may be.

f. "Non-Commercial Purpose" means any use of the Program or its Derivatives in
which you do not receive any direct or indirect payment related to that use. Any
activity that generates revenue, involves deployment in production or
customer-facing services, or otherwise results in payment or commercial benefit is
not a Non-Commercial Purpose.

operation of the Program. For the avoidance of doubt, Outputs do not include any
components of the Program.

TBG.

Program you Distribute, and specify that any rights to use the Program shall be
directly granted by TBG to said third-party recipients pursuant to this License;

b. you must prominently display the following notice alongside the Distribution of
the Program (such as via a "Notice" text file distributed as part of such Program)

DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE,
ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH USE OF THIS PROGRAM."

permissions, or other purposes not covered by this License can be negotiated with
TBG. Please contact TBG directly to discuss custom licensing arrangements.

6. DISCLAIMERS
THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "WITH ALL FAULTS" WITH NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE AND MAY CONTAIN BUGS, ERRORS, INCOMPLETE
FEATURES, OR CAUSE UNINTENDED BEHAVIOR. TBG EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL REPRESENTATIONS
AND WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WHETHER BY STATUTE, CUSTOM, USAGE OR OTHERWISE
AS TO ANY MATTERS RELATED TO THE PROGRAM, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE,
SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. TBG MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR
REPRESENTATIONS THAT THE PROGRAM WILL BE ERROR FREE OR FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER
HARMFUL COMPONENTS, OR PRODUCE ANY PARTICULAR RESULTS.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL TBG BE LIABLE TO YOU OR
ANY THIRD PARTY (A) UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT,
NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, WARRANTY, OR OTHERWISE UNDER THIS LICENSE, OR (B) FOR
ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR SPECIAL DAMAGES OR
LOST PROFITS, EVEN IF TBG HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THE
PROGRAM AND ANY OUTPUT ARE NOT DESIGNED OR INTENDED FOR USE IN ANY APPLICATION OR
SITUATION WHERE FAILURE OR FAULT COULD REASONABLY BE ANTICIPATED TO LEAD TO SERIOUS
INJURY OF ANY PERSON OR TO SEVERE PHYSICAL, PROPERTY, OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE
(EACH, A "HIGH-RISK USE"). IF YOU ELECT TO USE THE PROGRAM FOR A HIGH-RISK USE, YOU
DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK.

8. INDEMNIFICATION
You will indemnify, defend and hold harmless TBG from and against any losses,
liabilities, damages, fines, penalties, and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with any claim, demand, allegation,
lawsuit, proceeding, or investigation arising out of or related to (a) your access
to or use of the Program (including any Output generated from such access or use);
(b) your violation of this License; or (c) your violation, misappropriation or
infringement of any rights of another.

9. Termination; Survival
a. This License will automatically terminate upon any breach by you of the terms of
this License.
b. TBG may terminate this License, in whole or in part, at any time.

11. License Document Distribution
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.

12. General
This License will be governed and construed under the laws of Spain without regard
to conflicts of law provisions. If any provision or part of a provision of this
License is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision
is deemed severed from this License, and will not affect the validity and
enforceability of any remaining provisions. The failure of TBG to exercise or
enforce any right or provision of this License will not operate as a waiver of such
right or provision. This License does not confer any third-party beneficiary rights
upon any other person or entity. This License contains the entire understanding
between you and TBG regarding the subject matter of this License, and supersedes
all other written or oral agreements and understandings between you and TBG
regarding such subject matter.

If you do not agree to these terms, do not use the Program.

Addendum — Embedded Third-Party Code Notice
Certain components of TBG Enhanced Tiled Upscaler and Refiner Pro (the “Program”)
incorporate or are derived from third-party software that is distributed under its
own license terms (each, an “Embedded Component”). Each Embedded Component, and all
files that are wholly or substantially based on it, remain governed by the license
that accompanies that component.

If an Embedded Component’s license imposes obligations that conflict with, narrow,
or expand the permissions or restrictions in the TBG Custom License, the Embedded
Component’s license prevails for that component only; the TBG Custom License
continues to apply to all other portions of the Program.

A current list of Embedded Components and their respective licenses is provided in
the folder vendor LICENSES.txt distributed with the Program. If you require
clarification regarding any Embedded Component or its licensing, contact us 
before using, modifying, or distributing the Program.

Except as stated in this Addendum, all terms of the TBG Enhanced Tiled Upscaler and
Refiner Pro – Custom License remain in full force and effect.
